<p>Yep, I know you've been eagerly awaiting the second part of our journey in building an amazing AI-powered chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs). But, you know what? Something happened while I was working on my very own LLM app. I discovered that each embedding model I experimented with produced different and intriguing results. Some were simply so good, while others fell a bit short of expectations. That got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how can we truly grasp the power of these embedding models and understand their impact on chatbot performance?</p>

<p>So, I couldn't resist the urge to share my insights with you through this article. Trust me, it's well worth your time to equip yourself with this essential knowledge before diving headfirst into your own projects. After all, every great house is built upon a solid foundation, right? Now, don't worry, I promise this won't be a dull university lecture. I've made sure to include plenty of practical tutorials and engaging examples to keep you excited throughout the read. Similar to the post on how to use Llamaindex's Index correctly, I will take the same approach for this article</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let's embark on this fascinating journey together and uncover the secrets of embedding models. Let's get started!</p>
<h2>What is Vector Embedding</h2>
<p>In the realm of AI chatbot development, vector embedding plays a pivotal role in capturing the essence of textual information. At its core, vector embedding refers to the process of representing words, sentences, or even entire documents as dense, low-dimensional vectors in a mathematical space. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse representations like one-hot encoding, vector embeddings encapsulate the semantic relationships between words and enable algorithms to comprehend their contextual meaning.</p>
<p><img alt="By Partee" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*ICGYEfQuwRUoadqbWrZLkw.png" /></p>
<p>By employing techniques like Word Embeddings, Sentence Embeddings, or Contextual embedding, vector embeddings provide a compact and meaningful representation of textual data. Word embeddings, for instance, map words to fixed-length vectors, where words with similar meanings are positioned closer to one another in the vector space. This allows for efficient semantic search, information retrieval, and language understanding tasks.</p>
<p>The importance of vector embedding lies in its ability to transform the raw text into a numerical representation that algorithms can comprehend and reason with. This transformative process not only facilitates various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also serves as a fundamental building block for large language models. Vector embeddings empower these models to leverage the rich semantic information embedded within the textual data, enabling them to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.</p>
<h2>How Vector Embeddings Capture Semantic Information</h2>
<p>Vector embeddings capture semantic information by representing words, sentences, or documents as dense vectors in a mathematical space. These vectors are designed to encode contextual and semantic relationships between textual elements, allowing for more nuanced understanding and analysis.</p>
<p>The process of capturing semantic information begins with training a vector embedding model on a large corpus of text. During training, the model learns to assign vectors to words or sequences of words in a way that reflects their semantic similarity and context. This is achieved by analyzing the co-occurrence patterns of words in the training data.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*3VFmJlsGYcnvEDl8.jpg" /></p>
<p>For example, in word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, words that often appear together in similar contexts are represented by vectors that are positioned closer to one another in the embedding space. This proximity reflects their semantic similarity. By leveraging the statistical patterns of word usage across a vast dataset, these embeddings capture semantic relationships, such as synonyms, analogies, or even broader concepts like gender or sentiment.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about in-depth of vector embedding, you may find this post super helpful, thank you Partee for doing such a great job explaining vector embedding: <a href="https://partee.io/2022/08/11/vector-embeddings/">https://partee.io/2022/08/11/vector-embeddings/</a></p>
<h2>Importance of Vector Embeddings for Large Language Model Applications</h2>
<p>Vector embeddings hold immense importance in the realm of large language model (LLM) applications. LLMs, such as GPT-3, BERT, or Transformer-based models, have gained significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.</p>
<p>The success of LLMs hinges on their understanding of the semantic intricacies of natural language. This is where vector embeddings come into play. By utilizing vector embeddings, LLMs can leverage the rich semantic information embedded within textual data, enabling them to generate more sophisticated and context-aware responses.</p>
<p>Vector embeddings serve as a bridge between the raw textual input and the language model's neural network. Instead of feeding the model with discrete words or characters, the embeddings provide a continuous representation that captures the meaning and context of the input. This allows LLMs to operate at a higher level of language understanding and produce more coherent and contextually appropriate outputs.</p>
<p>The importance of vector embeddings for LLMs extends beyond language generation. These embeddings also facilitate a range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, and more. By incorporating pre-trained vector embeddings, LLMs can leverage the knowledge captured during the embedding training process, leading to improved performance on these tasks.</p>
<p>Moreover, vector embeddings enable transfer learning and fine-tuning in LLMs. Pre-trained embeddings can be shared across different models or even different domains, providing a starting point for training models on specific tasks or datasets. This transfer of knowledge allows for faster training, improved generalization, and better performance on specialized tasks.</p>
<hr />
<p>By now, you should have a solid grasp of vector embedding and its significance in developing LLM applications. In the following sections, let's dive straight into comparing different embedding models. If you're like me, someone seeking alternative options to OpenAI's API due to too poor to pay for it :(, this guide will help you choose the most suitable embedding model for your specific task.</p>
<p>Again, I will leave all the hard work to explain vector embedding to experts <a href="https://partee.io/2022/08/11/vector-embeddings/">here</a>. My job at this post is to bring some practical approach and high-level knowledge, so let's get started.</p>
<h2>LlamaIndex Embedding Options</h2>
<p>By default, LlamaIndex uses OpenAI's <em>text-embedding-ada-002</em> as a default embedding vector model. Even OpenAI also suggest using this model for all general purpose because according to them, this model is and I quote "cheapest and fastest" than other models. But is it though?</p>
<p>If you want to look into different embedding models that OpenAI offers, you can find them <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings">[here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)</a> and here. But how cheap it is exactly?</p>
<p>You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.</p>
<p><img alt="By OpenAI" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*TtwV_S8Kf1dYJCg9J2xgZA.png" /></p>
<p>Only $0.0004 / 1K token is very cheap at first glance. However, in reality, it can quickly become expensive. Let me illustrate with an example: 
<em>Suppose you want to build a chatbot to chat with your corporate's doc and you have <strong>10,000,000</strong> files (pretty average in legal documents or patient records), with an average text length of 20000 tokens. In this scenario, you would end up spending: (10,000,000 x 20,000 x 0.0004) / 1000 = $80,000 solely on embeddings</em></p>
<p>While the OpenAI model is indeed perfect for general purposes even with the <em>text-embedding-ada-002.</em> If you only build an app to read your file, then it is fine but imagine running a startup in that the user submits that amount of tokens monthly :( of course, you will charge customers monthly but still not profitable since you pay a decent trunk for the API already. Not to mention that</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OpenAI's API is slow sometimes due to huge requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may want to call this API multiple times for the same document since you may have multiple indexes built on top of each other or separately.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is why, we will explore other kinds of completely free models that we can deploy on our own.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, LlamaIndex does allow us to use other embedding models instead of using OpenAI. There are two options you can go with if you don't want to use OpenAI's embedding model</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use HuggingFace and all the available embedding models that HuggingFace offers <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring your own embedding model. You can either publish your model to HuggingFace and go back to step 1 or if you want to keep your model private then there is a lot of work you need to do. You need to build a custom code that uses LlamaIndex's Retrieval instead of using LlamaIndex's default option which only supports OpenAI embedding and HuggingFace Embedding with Langchain wrap at the moment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to find the right embedding for your task?</h2>
<p>If you still want to use OpenAI because you can afford it and want to use the leader of the field, then you can find all model that is suitable for your task <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings">here</a></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*GVbNkU3afp6MyQjaWnk9Aw.png" /></p>
<p>While OpenAI's embedding model is widely known, it's essential to recognize that there are alternative options available. Hugging Face, a renowned platform in the NLP community hosts the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard. This leaderboard serves as a valuable resource for evaluating the performance of various text embedding models across diverse embedding tasks. For a comprehensive understanding of the MTEB Leaderboard and its significance, I recommend referring to the "MTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark" available at (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb</a>). It provides a thorough explanation of the leaderboard's purpose and insights into different text embedding models. Exploring this resource will broaden your understanding of the text embedding landscape and assist you in making informed decisions for your embedding needs.</p>
<p><img alt="By https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*smKXaP33HvXKiGvK7cW4ug.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/types-of-embedding-models">text-embedding-ada-002</a> is ranked 6th only in terms of overall. But does that mean we should use <a href="https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large-v2">e5-large-v2</a> for all of our tasks? Not quite !!!!</p>
<p>Since we are building question-answering based on our knowledge base, we should pay attention to the tab Retrieval.</p>
<p><img alt="By https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*cEVZIJDYRk6rnnHJrwhlWA.png" /></p>
<p>And the winner is, not surprisingly the mighty <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/types-of-embedding-models">text-embedding-ada-002</a>. The <a href="https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large">instructor-large</a> is only 0.39 points behind while the king <a href="https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large-v2">e5-large-v2</a> is not even made to the top 10.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the most complicated embedding model <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/types-of-embedding-models">text-search-davinci-001</a> falls out of the top 20 despite the fact that OpenAI claims it performs Text similarity models and Text search models better than other relative models with costs 500x more than ada-002.</p>
<p>That is very interesting because now we do have some open-source models that can perform similarly to the mighty <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/types-of-embedding-models">text-embedding-ada-002</a>. Let's try it, shall we?</p>
<h2>Custom Embedding Model</h2>
<p>As previously stated, we will employ the <a href="https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large">instructor-large</a> model provided by HuggingFace. For the sake of a straightforward demonstration, I will utilize ChromaDB instead of Pinecone. Should you require a refresher on index storage, please refer to my previous post.</p>

```</p>
<p>Get some dummy data</p>
<p>```python
from pathlib import Path
import requests</p>
<p>wiki_titles = ["Toronto", "Seattle", "Chicago", "Boston", "Houston", "New York City"]</p>
<p>for title in wiki_titles:
    response = requests.get(
        'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php',
        params={
            'action': 'query',
            'format': 'json',
            'titles': title,
            'prop': 'extracts',
            # 'exintro': True,
            'explaintext': True,
        }
    ).json()
    page = next(iter(response['query']['pages'].values()))
    wiki_text = page['extract']</p>
<pre><code>data_path = Path('data')
if not data_path.exists():
    Path.mkdir(data_path)

with open(data_path / f"{title}.txt", 'w', encoding="utf-8") as fp:
    fp.write(wiki_text)
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<p>Read all the documents. I only use New York and Houston for comparison.</p>
<p>```python</p>
<p>docs= ['New York City','Houston.txt']
all_docs = {}
for d in docs:
    doc = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_files=[f"./data/{d}"]).load_data()
    nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(doc)
    doc_id = d.replace(" ","_")
    doc[0].doc_id = d
    ## this can be used for metadata filtering if need
    extra_info = {"id":d}
    doc[0].extra_info = extra_info
    all_docs[d] = doc
```</p>
<p>Create the index. This will create a mighty GPTVectorStoreIndex. You can try with other indexes if you want. Again, I have written a very comprehensive article on what other indexes do. You can find it <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanntk/llamaindex-how-to-use-index-correctly-6f928b8944c6">here</a></p>
<p><code>python
index_existed = False
for d in all_docs.keys():
    print(f"Creating/Updating index {d}")
    if index_existed:
        ## update index
        print(f"Updating index: {d}")
        # index_node.insert_nodes(all_nodes[d])
        index.insert(all_docs[d][0])
    else:  
        print(f"Creating new index: {d}")
        index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
                            all_docs[d],
                            service_context=service_context, 
                            storage_context=storage_context
        )
        index_existed = True</code></p>
<p>Now, let's experiment with a few queries</p>
<p><code>python
index.as_query_engine().query("What is population of New York?")</code></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*RzBBIpUMzFOqipXi6S7EJg.png" /></p>
<p>That is correct, this query just simply finds the population of New York City from the document.</p>
<p>We will do it again with Houston city</p>
<p><code>python
index.as_query_engine().query("What is population of Houston?")</code></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*_qgtW6a-tGvICMvZ3znqNw.png" /></p>
<p>Too easy, now let's do something harder. I will ask the question of comparing the population between these two cities. We expect to have a result something like New York City has a large population compared to Houston.</p>
<p><code>python
index.as_query_engine().query("Compare the population of New York and Houston?")</code></p>
<p>And the result?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*b4D_uX7lJ6Jh7lXB_hngwA.png" /></p>
<p>What is disappointing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question does not provide information about the population of Houston, so it cannot be answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, but you did say the population of Houston is 2,304,580 as of 2020.</p>
<p>What did we do wrong here? is LLM shockingly stupid? Should we change the embedding model to something else like OpenAI text-embedding-ada?</p>
<p>I've asked that questions and done a lot of experiments and frankly, it does not help at all. The thing is, the index.as_query_engine() is a default function. For a query like this, you need to customize your query engine to make it perform better. So, instead of using the <strong>as_query_engine()</strong> by default, we will use the custom retriever and with custom response modes.</p>
<p>For more information, you can find the details of the <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/retriever/root.html">retriever</a> and <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/query_engine/root.html">query engine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pay attention on how you create the query engine cause it will vastly impact to the result</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before changing the code, here is a quick summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/retriever/root.html">Retrievers</a> are responsible for fetching the most relevant context given a user query (or chat message). While query engine is a generic interface that allows you to ask question over your data. A query engine takes in a natural language query, and returns a rich response. It is most often (but not always) built on one or many <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/index/root.html">Indices</a> via Retrievers. You can compose multiple query engines to achieve more advanced capability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's change the code.</p>
<p>```python</p>
<h1>configure retriever</h1>
<p>from llama_index.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever
from llama_index.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine</p>
<h1>this will simple do the vector search and return the top 2 similarity</h1>
<h1>with the question being asked.</h1>
<p>retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(
    index=index, 
    similarity_top_k=2,
)</p>
<h1>configure response synthesizer</h1>
<p>response_synthesizer = ResponseSynthesizer.from_args(verbose=True)</p>
<h2>if you nee to pass response mode</h2>
<h1>response_synthesizer = ResponseSynthesizer.from_args(</h1>
<h1>response_mode='tree_summarize',</h1>
<h1>verbose=True)</h1>
<h1>assemble query engine</h1>
<p>query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(
    retriever=retriever,
    response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer,
)</p>
<h1>query</h1>
<p>response = query_engine.query("Compare the population of New York and Houston.")
response
```</p>
<p>And the result</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*r9-XDDGuiD7mObaXZq-8JQ.png" /></p>
<p><em><strong>New York City has a population of 8,804,190, while Houston has a population of 2,304,580. New York City is more than three times as populous as Houston.</strong></em></p>
<p>That is too good. With just a simple change, we now can answer the comparison question based on the general knowledge from the documents we feed.</p>
<p>If you wonder what is <em><strong>tree_summary</strong></em> in the ResponseSynthesizer, here is a quick summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>default</code>: "create and refine" an answer by sequentially going through each retrieved <code>Node</code>; This makes a separate LLM call per Node. Good for more detailed answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>compact</code>: "compact" the prompt during each LLM call by stuffing as many <code>Node</code> text chunks that can fit within the maximum prompt size. If there are too many chunks to stuff in one prompt, "create and refine" an answer by going through multiple prompts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tree_summarize</code>: Given a set of <code>Node</code> objects and the query, recursively construct a tree and return the root node as the response. Good for summarization purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>no_text</code>: Only runs the retriever to fetch the nodes that would have been sent to the LLM, without actually sending them. Then can be inspected by checking <code>response.source_nodes</code>. The response object is covered in more detail in Section 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>accumulate</code>: Given a set of <code>Node</code> objects and the query, apply the query to each <code>Node</code> text chunk while accumulating the responses into an array. Returns a concatenated string of all responses. Good for when you need to run the same query separately against each text chunk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default mode is good enough for most of the cases.</p>
<p>Now, let's try something more spicy.</p>
<p>```ini</p>
<h1>query</h1>
<p>response = query_engine.query("""
Compare the population of New York and Houston. 
What is the percentage difference between two populations?
""")
```</p>
<p>Here, I asked a similar question but also ask the LLM model to spit the percentage difference between the two populations. And here is the result</p>
<p><em><strong>The population of New York City in 2020 was 8,804,190, while the population of Houston in 2020 was 2,320,268. This means that the population of New York City is approximately 278% larger than the population of Houston.</strong></em></p>
<p>It's quite amusing to witness how LLM excels at retrieving information but falls short in accurately calculating numbers. For instance, the state "_<strong>New York City is approximately 278% larger than the population of Houston."</strong>i_s correct but we are not asking how the bigger population of New York compare to Houston. We are asking about the "percentage difference" between the two populations.</p>
<p>So, how do we find the percentage difference (% difference calculator) between two positive numbers greater than 0 anyway?</p>
<p>Here is the correct formula for V1 and V2, assuming V1 is bigger than V2</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*-zuqgJJ2id1Xztaf9doD0A.png" /></p>
<p>By following this formula, we should get the number is approximately: <strong>117.017</strong>% <strong>difference</strong></p>
<p>So how do we fix the problem?</p>
<p>LlamaIndex proves to be exceptionally proficient in answering questions related to documents. It seems that the entire project is centred around this purpose, enabling effortless inquiry atop a comprehensive collection of documents, with LlamaIndex flawlessly handling the task at hand.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this limitation, we will need to delve into a significantly larger project known as <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html">Langchain</a>. It is ironic, considering I initially mentioned in my first post that we would be building the app using LlamaIndex. However, we have encountered a major obstacle, and as per the fundamental principle of all startups - failing fast and pivoting - we must seek a more suitable alternative that aligns with our requirements.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*C0_oqnU9AePk0W5y" /></p>

<h2>Hello Langchain</h2>
<p>Trust me, it is not another typical project on how to build LLM apps with Langchain, we have too many articles and videos about that already. It is kinda boring if I have to do it again. If you don't know what is Langchain, just do a quick Google search and spend a few days on all the tutorials and videos and go through the official document. If you know enough about Langchain already, that is good to process further.</p>
<p>As this article is long already, I will just post a code with a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>In short, we will use the following component of Langchain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vector Storage ( LLM Database ): similar to LlamaIndex vector storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Langchain's Agent: this is what made Langchain popular</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Langchain's chain: RetrievalQA is made for question answering only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Langchain's chain: LLMMathChain is used when you need to answer questions about math.</p>

<p>Now, I know it is a lot to take in. Again, please go through the official documents to understand what are the components about. I will find some time to put on all the Langchain tutorials/articles/videos from beginner to advanced in future posts. So please subscribe and follow to get more :)</p>
<p>Langchain boasts incredible power, enabling you to construct virtually any LLM application you can envision. Unlike LlamaIndex, which is solely focused on LLM applications for documents, Langchain offers a plethora of capabilities. It can assist you in developing various functionalities such as internet search, result consolidation, API invocation, mathematical computations, even complex mathematical operations, and a whole host of other possibilities.</p>
<p>Let's get into it</p>
<p>```python
import logging
import sys
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<your openai api key>"</p>
<h2>load all the necessary components</h2>
<p>from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, TextLoader
from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredFileLoader
```</p>
<p>Use a custom embedding</p>
<p>```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings</p>
<p>model_id = "hkunlp/instructor-large"
embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_id)
vectorstore = Chroma("langchain_store", embed_model)
```</p>
<p>Load the documents and add them to the vector store</p>
<p>```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)</p>
<p>docs= ['New York City','Houston.txt']
all_docs = []
for d in docs:
    print(f"#### Loading data: {d}")
    doc = UnstructuredFileLoader(f"./data/{d}",  strategy="hi_res").load()
    doc = text_splitter.split_documents(doc)
    all_docs.extend(doc)</p>
<h2>add to vector store</h2>
<p>vectorstore.add_documents(all_docs)
```</p>
<p>Create the question-answering chain</p>
<p><code>python
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2,model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
                                 chain_type="stuff", 
                                 retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())
result = qa({"query": "Compare the population of New York and Houston. What is the percentage difference between two populations?"})
result</code></p>
<p>And the result:</p>
<p><em><strong>According to the 2020 U.S. census, New York City has a population of 8,804,190, while Houston has a population of 2,304,580. The percentage difference between the two populations is approximately 282%</strong></em></p>
<p>Still, give us the 282% out of nowhere. Let's fix it with the <strong>LLM-math</strong> chain and agent.</p>
<p>Add Math Chain and Agent</p>
<p>```python
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMMathChain</p>
<p>llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
llm_math = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm, verbose=True)</p>
<p>from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.tools import BaseTool</p>
<p>tools = [
    Tool(
        name="general knowledge",
        func=qa.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the documents in the database"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="llm-math",
        func=llm_math.run,
        description="Useful for when you need to answer questions about math."
    )
]</p>
<p>agent = initialize_agent(tools, ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2,model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo'), 
                         agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)</p>
<p>agent.run("""Compare the population of New York and Houston. 
What is the percentage difference between two populations?""")
```</p>
<p>And here is the result:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*biytMMeEjGfoxKJ9PahWeg.png" /></p>
<p>This is so good, you see the agent will first find the information from the general knowledge tool to get the population of the two cities. After the first step, it uses LLM-math to calculate the percentage difference between two numbers. 
Do you see how smart it is? It is smart enough to know what tool is used for what purpose. That is why we go all in for Langchain guys :)</p>
<hr />
<p>As I have stated, Langchain is much much bigger than LlamaIndex and Langchain project focuses more on creating AGI applications as it supposes a lot of utilities such as web browser, call the API with OpenAPI model, etc.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for me to create yet another Langchain tutorial. I trust you guys can do it by looking into the official document. I will find some time to consolidate all the Langchain tutorials and videos from beginner to advance. In the meantime, I will upgrade my PC and start writing the next practical post. And this time, it is gonna be a part 2.</p>
