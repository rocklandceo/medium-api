<h1>Perfect tech Stack to choose for AI-Driven SaaS</h1>
<p>AI is playing a significant role in our day-to-day life, it's helping businesses to ease the workload making the user experience better on the SaaS, saving time in writing and communicating with customers, and tons of different use cases are there for AI-Driven SaaS in the market. If you are planning to start such a SaaS project and need a clear understanding of how to approach it then in this article I'm going to share some tech-stack you can look into for your AI-Driven SaaS project.</p>
<p>But before we jump in, I want to share the book that I've recently written <strong><a href="https://shivanshudev.gumroad.com/l/cheatcodeforsaas">"Cheat Code to Build a SaaS"</a></strong>, in this book I've explained all the steps, tips, and tricks, some valuable resources, and how you can kick off with your SaaS. This book will answer most of your questions and in case if you have any further questions feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>We will be covering from the ground up to a finished product, we will be talking about,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Frontend Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backend Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI Model Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Databases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting and Cloud</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the main 5 points that you need to be aware of for AI-Driven SaaS development, one thing in focus in this article I'm only going to talk about AI no other use case or SaaS projects I'm going to explain.</p>
<h2><strong>Frontend Development</strong></h2>
<p>For the frontend development, we can choose the following libraries,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>React JS with Vite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next JS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Svelte JS</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And also it would be better to start with a pre-build template for your SaaS not creating a UI/UX from scratch this would save you time and money.</p>
<p>For templates I choose from, <a href="https://mui.com/store">https://mui.com/store</a></p>
<p>You can also choose what you like according to your preference but doing all <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a> and UI/UX from scratch would be a waste of time and money for the MVP.</p>
<h2>Backend Development</h2>
<p>Backend Development is very important especially when your SaaS is based on AI. For the backend development of AI-Driven SaaS, I would recommend,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Django (Python Recommended):</strong> Django is a full-stack framework for web developers working with Python. Essentially, its aim is to reduce the overall web development process when building web apps. Among the major benefits of using Django for back-end web development is its Representational State Transfer (REST) framework, which is a popular toolkit for building APIs. The power of Django's REST framework can be assessed from the fact that it takes just three lines of code to build a ready-to-use API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Node JS with Nest JS:</strong> This will be used to write the backend logic along with the functionality of the application. NestJS is a Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It is based on TypeScript and JavaScript. This framework is inspired by Angular, so most of what you find in Angular can also be found in Nest, including providers, middleware, components, and services. It is safe to say that Nest can be easily learned by Angular developers for any type of project. Nest makes use of the Express HTTP framework by default. However, Nest is platform agnostic, meaning it can work with any Node HTTP framework. For example, it can optionally be <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/platform-fastify">configured to use Fastify</a>, which can improve the Node framework.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now one thing in mind we should also consider using GraphQL only if your application is not going to grow too much data extensively in the future.</p>
<h2>AI Model Development</h2>
<p>I would recommend never ever starting a war in developing your own AI-based SaaS application from scratch there, yes you could be unique and will have your model which you can market later but the chances of getting such a thing in work for a startup could be very risky, big tech companies like <a href="https://openai.com/">[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)</a>, <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard</a> already have tons of data and a good team of developers with them to code and make such things to work, let assume even if you have created such application successfully at that time your competitors would have even developed more features to their application, it's like they would be 10 steps ahead form you. The best option would be to make use of the OpenAI APIs that are provided and make the model train on top of it.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>For the database, the best one should be <a href="https://mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> if you wanted to go with NoSQL which is what I would go with else if you want to go with SQL then <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. Make sure your database is designed as materialized view and has a multi-node structure.</p>
<h2>Hosting and Deployment:</h2>
<p>For the hosting and deployment you can choose from many cloud providers but I would say you can pick from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in">[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in)</a>. Also more importantly you should pick up the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups">Startup Program</a> where you can get up to $5,000 credits from Azure.</p>
<p><img alt="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*frPStFv8y8BvfoxP5lyD5w.png" /></p>
<p>The Startup Program helps you to push and build your MVP and also get further credits like $25,000 if your program grows.</p>
<p>Azure Startup Program: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups</a></p>
<p>AWS Activate: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">https://aws.amazon.com/activate/</a></p>
<p>I hope you have got a general understanding of how you can build and run your AI-Driven SaaS application, if you have even more questions and doubts feel free to reach me out or check my <a href="https://shivanshudev.gumroad.com/l/cheatcodeforsaas">book here</a>.</p>
