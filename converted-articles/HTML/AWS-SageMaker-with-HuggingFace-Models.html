<h1>AWS SageMaker real-time endpoints with HuggingFace Embedding Models: A Guide for LLM Application</h1>
<p>and how to ingest embedding data into vector database with real-time inference embedding endpoint with Langchain</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure if I should officially label this as "part 2" of the series building a Chatbot app that's totally unique compared to 99% of the tutorials out there on the internet and is production-ready. 
The content we'll cover here sets the groundwork for the rest of our Chatbot journey. Even though I haven't explicitly labelled it as "part 2," I assure you it's a mandatory step. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get ready for some exciting progress!</p>

<h2>Frustrations with Superficial Articles on the Search for an In-Depth Guide</h2>
<p>Before I started, I want to highlight the frustration and the reason I want to write this article.</p>
<p>I've often come across articles with enticing titles like "Develop Your Own AI to Read Your Documents" or "Develop AI Applications with Langchain/Llamaindex." However, I've noticed that most of these articles tend to be quite basic, lacking in-depth discussions on the topics they promise to cover. It appears that many of these articles simply regurgitate information from official documents without providing any meaningful analysis or technical insights. This trend is also evident when searching for articles on Hugging Face's embedding.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo by Tim Gouw on Unsplash" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*2bfq-L3nNBipaJS1" /></p>
<p>Please understand that I do appreciate the value of these articles for individuals who are new to the subject matter and seek introductory information. However, as someone who delves into intricate technical details and craves in-depth exploration, I find these articles lacking in substance. It seems that the popularity of certain topics has led to an overwhelming number of articles covering the same information, resulting in a monotonous and uninteresting feed on platforms like Medium.</p>
<p>Personally, I have been searching for a comprehensive guide on deploying any Hugging Face's embedding model to AWS Sagemaker, but to no avail. Instead, I repeatedly encounter similar articles authored by different individuals, all offering a summary of the basic steps to deploy a Hugging Face embedding model to Sagemaker. The frustrating part is that they all seem to use the same Hugging Face model and even the same instance type.</p>
<p>What I truly desire is an in-depth, step-by-step tutorial that starts from scratch and guides me through the entire deployment process. Regrettably, I haven't been able to find such a guide. Consequently, I have taken it upon myself to write an article that may prove interesting and helpful to anyone else who has experienced this same struggle.</p>

<h2>AWS Sagemaker</h2>
<p>Over the past 8 years, I've had the pleasure of working extensively with a variety of AWS products. When it comes to developing prototypes or MVPs, AWS has always been my top choice. I've built and designed multiple data platforms for companies of all sizes, from startups to large corporations. AWS is like the OG in the game, but I'll be honest, sometimes I wish their services were a bit easier to use. In fact, there have been entire startups created solely to make AWS more user-friendly.</p>
<p>Having said that, AWS's machine learning platform isn't my personal favourite. It can be a bit tricky to navigate and often leads to confusion. On the other hand, in the world of data engineering, both in my current company and previous ones, we tend to lean towards Databricks for most of our development work. Databricks is a breeze to use and a great tool for working with data and developing data lakehouse platforms. It also provides an awesome platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts to build and deploy models. The only downside is that Databricks can be a bit pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for, and Databricks delivers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*RG_jvnXtUJYHwfWf.jpg" /></p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, AWS offers all the features and capabilities that Databricks provides, and in some aspects, even surpasses it. AWS stands out because its services are well-integrated and easily usable together. Building machine learning platforms or data platforms on top of AWS is a breeze, as you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking honestly, AWS Sagemaker is an "okay" product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it can be difficult to use, and the notebook environment sucks, the overall functionality is acceptable. If your company heavily invests in AWS and utilizes it across all products, then it's highly likely you'll default to using AWS Sagemaker. As for us, and specifically for me, Sagemaker serves as the final step in the deployment process, thanks to its convenient endpoint deployment and seamless integration with API Gateway, Lambda, and ECS.</p>
<p>Recently, what piqued my interest and drew me back to working with Sagemaker is its partnership with Hugging Face. If you're reading this blog, you're probably a skilled engineer in the data space, be it a data engineer or a machine learning engineer, and I'm confident you're familiar with Hugging Face. Personally, I'm a huge fan of Hugging Face, and their collaboration with AWS has significantly bolstered the capabilities of Sagemaker.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*UmZBTYI2Sc_qqQsY.png" /></p>
<p>In this article, I won't dive into the nitty-gritty details of Sagemaker or how to use it. I also won't talk about building embedding models or using Hugging Face. If you're interested, I can cover those topics in future articles. For now, let's focus on the main topic: how to deploy any Hugging Face embedding model to AWS Sagemaker. It's going to be a fun and informative journey, so stick around!</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You need to have an AWS account. If you don't already have one, then please create a new one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to state again that this guide is not a tutorial on Sagemaker, it is also not a tutorial on how to use Hugging Face, nor one about how to build custom embedding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, you don't even need to know Sagemaker, just think about it as a platform where we are going to deploy our embedding model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hugging Face on Amazon Sagemaker</h2>
<p>If you are interested in how to deploy the Hugging Face model to Amazon Sagemaker, you can go through the official hugging face document here</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/index"><strong>Hugging Face on Amazon SageMaker</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, we will cover one thing which is "<strong>How to deploy any Hugging Face embedding model on AWS Sagemaker</strong>".</p>
<p>Traditionally, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-huggingface-inference-toolkit">SageMaker Hugging Face Inference Toolkit</a> supports the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/[pipelines](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html).html">pipeline feature</a> from Transformers for zero-code deployment. This means you can run compatible Hugging Face Transformer models without providing pre- &amp; post-processing code. Therefore we only need to provide an environment variable <code>HF_TASK</code> and <code>HF_MODEL_ID</code> when creating our endpoint and the Inference Toolkit will take care of it. This is a great feature if you are working with existing pipelines. To deploy any hugging face model on AWS Sagemaker, it is super simple this following code</p>
<p>```python
from sagemaker.huggingface.model import HuggingFaceModel</p>
<h1>Hub model configuration <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">https://huggingface.co/models</a></h1>
<p>hub = {
  'HF_MODEL_ID':'distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad', # model_id from hf.co/models
  'HF_TASK':'question-answering'                           # NLP task you want to use for predictions
}</p>
<h1>create Hugging Face Model Class</h1>
<p>huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
   env=hub,                                                # configuration for loading model from Hub
   role=role,                                              # IAM role with permissions to create an endpoint
   transformers_version="4.26",                             # Transformers version used
   pytorch_version="1.13",                                  # PyTorch version used
   py_version='py39',                                      # Python version used
)</p>
<h1>deploy model to SageMaker Inference</h1>
<p>predictor = huggingface_model.deploy(
   initial_instance_count=1,
   instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge"
)</p>
<h1>example request: you always need to define "inputs"</h1>
<p>data = {
"inputs": {
 "question": "What is used for inference?",
 "context": "My Name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg. This model is used with sagemaker for inference."
 }
}</p>
<h1>request</h1>
<p>predictor.predict(data)
```</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>HF_MODEL_ID</code> defines the model ID which is automatically loaded from <a href="http://huggingface.co/models">huggingface.co/models</a> when you create a SageMaker endpoint. Access 10,000+ models on the 🤗 Hub through this environment variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HF_TASK</code> defines the task for the 🤗 Transformers p<code>ipeline.</code> A complete list of tasks can be found h<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines">ere.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But HF_TASK does not have an embedding task yet. Therefore, we will need to custom code to serve the embedding endpoint.</p>
<h3>What about embedding tasks?</h3>
<p>By default, AWS Sagemaker officially supports these embedding models. It means if you want to use this model, you don't have to do anything extra. Just need to follow this notebook to deploy the supported embedding model.</p>
<p>But what if the official model is not the one you want? In fact, if you look at the hugging face's leaderboard, these embedding models are nowhere in the top rank of the data retrieval benchmark.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Hugging Face Inference Toolkit allows the user to override the default methods of the <code>HuggingFaceHandlerService</code>. You will need to create a folder named <code>code/</code> with an <code>inference.py</code> file in it. See <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/inference#create-a-model-artifact-for-deployment">here</a> for more details on how to archive your model artifacts. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*Wf8_7cdcL8WLEBQRsdhvGg.png" /></p>
<p>The <code>inference.py</code> file contains your custom inference module and the <code>requirements.txt</code> file contains additional dependencies that should be added. The custom module can override the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>model_fn(model_dir)</code></strong> overrides the default method for loading a model. The return value <code>model</code> will be used in <code>predict</code> for predictions. <code>predict</code> receives argument the <code>model_dir</code>, the path to your unzipped <code>model.tar.gz</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>transform_fn(model, data, content_type, accept_type)</code></strong> overrides the default transform function with your custom implementation. You will need to implement your own <code>preprocess</code>, <code>predict</code> and <code>postprocess</code> steps in the <code>transform_fn</code>. This method can't be combined with <code>input_fn</code>, <code>predict_fn</code> or <code>output_fn</code> mentioned below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>input_fn(input_data, content_type)</code></strong> overrides the default method for preprocessing. The return value <code>data</code> will be used in <code>predict</code> for predictions. The inputs are:
<code>- input_data</code> is the raw body of your request.
<code>- content_type</code> is the content type from the request header.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>predict_fn(processed_data, model)</code></strong> overrides the default method for predictions. The return value <code>predictions</code> will be used in <code>postprocess</code>. The input is <code>processed_data</code>, the result from <code>preprocess</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>output_fn(prediction, accept)</code></strong> overrides the default method for postprocessing. The return value <code>result</code> will be the response to your request (e.g.<code>JSON</code>). The inputs are:
<code>- predictions</code> is the result from <code>predict</code>.
<code>- accept</code> is the return accept type from the HTTP Request, e.g. <code>application/json</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development Environment</h2>
<p>First, you need to create a custom IAM Role. You will need to use this role for most of your work so go ahead and create one.</p>
<p><code>yaml

<p>If you want to use your local notebook, you need to note down the role name you've created above to manually set it in the code later.</p>
<p><strong>The next step is optional:</strong> You can accomplish this guide with your local notebook environment and memory vector database with Chroma. However, if you want to have something serious, you can create a notebook instance along with the OpenSeach service.
With AWS Free Tier, you can have <em><strong>250 hours free of ml.t3.medium instance and up to 750 hours per month of a t2.small.search or t3.small.search instance</strong></em></p>

<p>For the rest of the article, I will use the notebook instance. You can do the same with your local notebook. Let's start with the first task.</p>
<p><strong>Install the necessary libraries</strong></p>
<p><code>shell
!pip install langchain
!pip install opensearch-py
!pip install chromadb</code></p>
<p><strong>Install <code>git</code> and <code>git-lfs</code></strong></p>
<p>```ruby</p>
<h1>For notebook instances (Amazon Linux)</h1>
<p>!sudo yum update -y
!curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
!sudo yum install git-lfs git -y
```</p>
<p>An alternative way to install <strong>git-lfs</strong> if the previous one does not work for you</p>
<p><code>shell
!sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras
!sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
!sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
!sudo yum install git-lfs -y</code></p>
<p><strong>Set Permission.</strong></p>
<p>```python
import sagemaker
import boto3</p>
<p>sess = sagemaker.Session()
sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()</p>
<p>try:
    aws_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
except ValueError:
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    aws_role= iam.get_role(RoleName='SageMakerIAMRole')['Role']['Arn']</p>
<p>aws_region = sess.region_name</p>
<p>print(f"sagemaker role arn: {role}")
print(f"sagemaker bucket: {sagemaker_session_bucket}")
print(f"sagemaker region: {aws_region}")
```</p>
<p>Now, it is all set. Next step, I will delve into how to deploy two different embedding models</p>
<h2>Example 1: <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a></h2>
<p>This is the most basic embedding model that is offered by HuggingFace. Let's have a look at the documentation.</p>
<p>```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F</p>
<h1>Mean Pooling - Take attention mask into account for correct averaging</h1>
<p>def mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):
    token_embeddings = model_output[0] #First element of model_output contains all token embeddings
    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()
    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)</p>
<h1>Sentences we want sentence embeddings for</h1>
<p>sentences = ['This is an example sentence', 'Each sentence is converted']</p>
<h1>Load model from HuggingFace Hub</h1>
<p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')</p>
<h1>Tokenize sentences</h1>
<p>encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')</p>
<h1>Compute token embeddings</h1>
<p>with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)</p>
<h1>Perform pooling</h1>
<p>sentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])</p>
<h1>Normalize embeddings</h1>
<p>sentence_embeddings = F.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)</p>
<p>print("Sentence embeddings:")
print(sentence_embeddings)
```</p>
<p>What does this code do anyway? Well, this is a low-level embedding function that is done by all-MiniLM-L6-v2. If you are using Langchain, you may be familiar with</p>
<p>```java</p>
<p>from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings</p>
<p>model_id = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_id)
```</p>
<p>Basically, <em><strong>HuggingFaceEmbedding</strong></em> wraps all the necessary stuff away for you. To deploy these embedding inference models on Sagemaker, we need to unwrap those codes and put them into an <strong>inference.py</strong></p>
<h3>Create a custom an <strong>inference.py</strong> script</h3>
<p>```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F</p>
<p>def mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):
    token_embeddings = model_output[0] 
    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()
    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)</p>
<p>def model_fn(model_dir):
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_dir)
  model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_dir)
  return model, tokenizer</p>
<p>def predict_fn(data, model_and_tokenizer):
    # destruct model and tokenizer
    model, tokenizer = model_and_tokenizer</p>
<pre><code># Tokenize sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Compute token embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)

# Perform pooling
sentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])

# Normalize embeddings
sentence_embeddings = F.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)

# return dictonary, which will be json serializable
return {"vector_embedding": sentence_embeddings.tolist()}
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<p>Please refer to <strong>What about embedding tasks</strong> section above for more information if you have forgotten what you have read already 😁</p>
<h3><strong>Create</strong> model.tar.gz with inference script and model</h3>
<p><code>ini
repository = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
model_id=repository.split("/")[-1]
s3_location=f"s3://{sess.default_bucket()}/custom_inference/{model_id}/model.tar.gz"</code></p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h2>download the model from hf model</h2>
<p>!git lfs install
!git clone https://huggingface.co/$repository</p>
<h2>copy inference.py and requirements.txt to code/ directory</h2>
<h2>this is mandatory to have files under code/ folder</h2>
<p>!cp -r inference.py $model_id/code/
!cp -r requirements.txt $model_id/code/</p>
<h2>create model.tar.gx archive with all the model artifacts</h2>
<p>%cd $model_id
!tar zcvf model.tar.gz *</p>
<h2>upload to S3</h2>
<p>!aws s3 cp model.tar.gz $s3_location
```</p>
<p><strong>Create a custom Huggingface Model</strong></p>
<p>```python
from sagemaker.huggingface.model import HuggingFaceModel</p>
<h1>create Hugging Face Model Class</h1>
<p>huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
   model_data=s3_location,       # path to your model and script
   role=role,                    # iam role with permissions to create an Endpoint
   transformers_version="4.26",  # transformers version used
   pytorch_version="1.13",        # pytorch version used
   py_version='py39',            # python version used
)</p>
<h1>deploy the endpoint endpoint</h1>
<p>predictor = huggingface_model.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge"
)
```</p>
<p>After this, you should have the embedding of real-time inference in the Sagemaker console.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, you may wonder, sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is already supported by AWS Sagemaer, why do we still need to go through this?</p>
<p>Well, example 1 is just a demonstration, I want to show example 1 because I want to show you the pattern on how to take any Huggingface model to Sagemaker not just only the official models.</p>
<p>As you will see, the beloved and almost champion in the embedding-retrieval <strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large">hkunlp/instructor-large</a></strong> will have a very different approach, but once you understand the logic behind it, you can onboard any models.
Let's try another one.</p>
<h2>Example 2: <a href="https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large">hkunlp/instructor-large</a></h2>
<p>If you look into the source code, the low-level embedding will be like this</p>
<p><code>bash
!pip install InstructorEmbedding</code></p>
<p>```python
from InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR</p>
<p>model = INSTRUCTOR('hkunlp/instructor-large')
sentence = "3D ActionSLAM: wearable person tracking in multi-floor environments"
instruction = "Represent the Science title:"
embeddings = model.encode([[instruction,sentence]])
print(embeddings)
```</p>
<p>Compare to <strong>sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2,</strong> there is no <em><strong>mean_pooling function or AutoTokenizer or AutoModel</strong></em>. It is just INSTRUCTOR. 
So how do we incorporate to <strong>inference.py</strong>?</p>
<p>First, this model requires to install InstructorEmbedding, so we need to install this library to the inference endpoint.</p>
<p>You need to create a <strong>requirements.txt</strong> with this content.</p>
<p><code>typescript
InstructorEmbedding</code></p>
<p>Modify the <strong>inference.py</strong> to follow instructor-embedding code.</p>
<p>```python
from InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR</p>
<p>def model_fn(model_dir):
  model = INSTRUCTOR(model_dir)
  return model</p>
<p>def predict_fn(data, model):
  embeddings = model.encode(data)
  return {"vector_embedding": sentence_embeddings.tolist()}
```</p>
<h3>Create model.tar.gz with inference script and model</h3>
<p><code>ini
repository = "hkunlp/instructor-large"
model_id=repository.split("/")[-1]
s3_location=f"s3://{sess.default_bucket()}/custom_inference/{model_id}/model.tar.gz"</code></p>
<p>```bash</p>

```</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h2>copy inference.py and requirements.txt to code/ directory</h2>
<h2>this is mandatory to have files under code/ folder</h2>
<p>!cp -r inference.py $model_id/code/
!cp -r requirements.txt $model_id/code/</p>
<h2>create model.tar.gx archive with all the model artifacts</h2>
<p>%cd $model_id
!tar zcvf model.tar.gz *</p>
<h2>upload to S3</h2>
<p>!aws s3 cp model.tar.gz $s3_location
```</p>
<p><strong>Create a custom Huggingface Model</strong></p>
<p>```python
from sagemaker.huggingface.model import HuggingFaceModel</p>
<h1>create Hugging Face Model Class</h1>
<p>huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
   model_data=s3_location,       # path to your model and script
   role=role,                    # iam role with permissions to create an Endpoint
   transformers_version="4.26",  # transformers version used
   pytorch_version="1.13",        # pytorch version used
   py_version='py39',            # python version used
)</p>
<h1>deploy the endpoint endpoint</h1>
<p>predictor = huggingface_model.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge"
)
```</p>
<p>After this, you should have the embedding of real-time inference in the Sagemaker console.</p>
<p>Now, you have the instructor-large embedding inference endpoint running on Sagemaker, let's integrate it into Langchain.</p>
<h2>Langchain with Sagemaker Real-time embedding Endpoint</h2>
<p>Langchain provides the <code>[SagemakerEndpointEmbeddings](https://notebooks.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?browser=chrome&amp;bypass_fastly=true&amp;color_mode=light&amp;commit=1308b2c7f0b5c259e02a3a6573c1ca2e6f1c073f&amp;device=unknown_device&amp;docs_host=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com&amp;enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6177732d73616d706c65732f6c6c6d2d617070732d776f726b73686f702f313330386232633766306235633235396530326133613635373363316361326536663163303733662f626c6f67732f7261672f646174615f696e67657374696f6e5f746f5f766563746f7264622e6970796e62&amp;logged_in=true&amp;nwo=aws-samples%2Fllm-apps-workshop&amp;path=blogs%2Frag%2Fdata_ingestion_to_vectordb.ipynb&amp;platform=windows&amp;repository_id=629772172&amp;repository_type=Repository&amp;version=114)</code> class which is a wrapper around a functionality to talk to a Sagemaker Endpoint to generate embeddings. We will override the <code>embed_documents</code> function to define our own batching strategy for sending requests to the model (multiple requests are sent in one model invocation). Similarly, we extend the <code>ContentHandlerBase</code> class to provide implementation for two abstract methods which define how to process (encode/decode) the input data sent to the model and the output received from the model.</p>
<p>We finally create a <code>SagemakerEndpointEmbeddingsJumpStart</code> object that puts all this together and can now be used by langchain to talk to an LLM deployed as a Sagemaker Endpoint to generate embeddings.</p>

<h3>Add Embedding Real-time Model to Chroma</h3>

<h3>Add Embedding Real-time Model to OpenSearch Service</h3>
<p>This is totally optional. If you have followed the yaml setup, you may already install the OpenSearch service. As mentioned, having Chroma in your local machine/notebook is fine for the experiment. If you need to bring your app to a high level of scale, then perhaps you need to either use a commercial vector database such as Pinecone or deploy your own database like Chroma on EC2 or AWS Managed OpenSearch service. Here is how to ingest data into OpenSearch with the real-time embedding endpoint.</p>
