<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Search engines primarily rely on natural language processing and machine learning to understand the meaning behind user queries and match them with relevant documents. But, how can we create a personal semantic search engine quickly? To answer that, it is of prior importance to understand the fundamental concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embeddings. <strong>Embeddings</strong> and <strong>LLMs</strong> are crucial tools that help to provide accurate and relevant search results.</p>
<p><img alt="&quot;The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world, and the most dangerous.&quot; (from The Case Book Of Sherlock Holmes - &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;) | Photo by Brandon Lopez on Unsplash" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*IUaAInYUDDjoxgIs" /></p>
<p>As an example, OpenAI has developed advanced search language processing models or LLMs. These models can process a corpus amount of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases. To further define LLMs, let's have a quick look at Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language model</a></strong> (<strong>LLM</strong>) is a language model consisting of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural network</a> with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning">self-[supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) learning</a>. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#cite_note-Manning-2022-1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*qnKP8VErFqPla3AjO16b1w.png" /></p>
<p>One such very popular LLM is <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3">GPT-3, developed by OpenAI</a>, which can generate highly fluent and coherent natural language text. GPT-3 can even write entire articles based on a small prompt provided by the user. Additionally, it can perform tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and answering questions (in form of an AI Assistance/Chat Bot). This technology can be incredibly useful in different areas such as online shopping, research, and <strong><em>note-taking tasks</em>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to cover such instances in my earlier blog posts and video tutorials. You can find the live demo app <a href="https://next.databutton.com/v/lgzxq112/Summarize_Articles">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 is especially useful in semantic search because it can interpret the meaning of a user's query and generate personalized and relevant results. <strong>Its semantic search considers the context and intent behind the query instead of just matching keywords (LLMs are great at this).</strong> For example, GPT-3 can generate more accurate search queries based on the user's input and it can analyze the content of web pages and other documents to identify key concepts and relationships, improving the accuracy of search results. <strong>In the context of semantic search, embeddings are one of the techniques that are commonly used.</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequently, I save tweets that are useful for sharing. I recently came across a tweet that could aid us in comprehending why the concept or execution of ‚Äòembedding' search is superior to keyword matching.</em></p>
<iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1639991419778772994%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" title="" height="281" width="500"></iframe>

<p>Also, here's how Open AI defines "embeddings" in its <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings">docs</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use">distance</a> between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, LLMs applied with embeddings can be powerful tools for improving the quality and relevance of search results for the development of a semantic search engine. Thus, through this blog post, we will walk through a fundamental use case where we can search through all of our notes at once using LLMs to develop a <em>personalised search engine</em>.</p>
<h3>Building the front-end</h3>
<p>As we discussed earlier, our search engine needs to accept queries from users for which, a simple easy-to-build user interface (UI) is of utmost necessity. We will create a minimalist UI using Databutton, an all-in-one online ecosystem that is Python-friendly and allows for the development and deployment of web applications quickly and easily. It has recently become one of my productivity hacks for quickly creating prototypes.üíú</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/0*R3JhzehSjhOQqkBC.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Why Databutton</strong>While working with Databutton we can ditch working in our local editor and avoid constant wrestling with our Python environment maintenance. Instead, we can take advantage of their minimalist text editor, pre-installed packages within the ‚ÄòConfiguration' space, hot-reloading enabled local hosts, beautiful Streamlit integrated front end, and seamless cloud service to write and deploy our web applications. Furthermore, Databutton allows for collaboration and co-writing of applications (It even has a ChatGPT plugged-in chatbot to assist with debugging the code when requested ü§Ø ).</p>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*KVyGB1UUPKCMVuLNSoZuEQ.png" /></p>
<p>Quick overview while developing our web app within Databutton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A) Configuration space üîê  - provides a secure place to maintain our Python environment and comes with pre-installed packages. This feature also allows us to store API secret keys.</p>
<p>B) IDE üìù  - the built-in IDE offers a default editor with auto-formatting using Black, linting with Flake8, and an additional functionality called ‚ÄòHot-reloading', which provides real-time visuals of our application in the local host.</p>
<p>C) LocalHost üîé  - enables us to constantly test our web app during the development process. With just one click of the "Publish pages" button, our app can be deployed in no time! üöÄ </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What's our workflow to build a semantic search engine?</h3>
<p>In this post, we will break down the whole process into two critical steps, even though it would ideally be demonstrated over a Databutton web app.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get <strong>embeddings</strong> for text data (using Jupyter/Collab Notebook)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building UI with <strong>Databutton -</strong> the front-end for search queries using embeddings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*D55M6VKF6yaV4qP4tvfj2g.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image above briefly describes the workflow for building a personal semantic search engine in our demo case study here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Get embeddings for text data</h3>
<p>We need to start with the installation of python libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Pandas</code> : a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis , <code>!pip install pandas</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>OpenAI</code> : a Python library to work with OpenAI API endpoints, <code>!pip install openai</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, using <code>get_embedding</code> function from <code>openai.embeddings_utils</code> we convert text into a numerical vector representation using OpenAI's language model. The resulting embeddings are stored in a new column of the dataframe and saved to a CSV file.</p>
<p><em>This code is used as a starting point for this project which can be alternatively automated within the web app. However to highlight this critical initial step in our project I choose to keep it separate from the UI development section.</em></p>
<p><strong>Importing the Modules</strong>Next, we import the modules. We also need to import a function called <code>get_embedding</code> from <code>openai.embeddings_utils</code>. T<strong>his function as previously mentioned is used to convert text into a numerical vector representation using OpenAI's language model.</strong></p>
<p><code>javascript
import pandas as pd
import openai
from openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding</code></p>
<p><strong>Ingesting our data</strong>We load a dataset named <code>Notes.xlsx</code> , further using <code>pd.read_excel</code> function we store it in a variable called <code>df</code>. This line of code is used to read the contents of an Excel file and convert it into a Pandas dataframe for further analysis.</p>
<p>```python</p>
<h1>Load &amp; inspect dataset</h1>
<p>input_datapath = "Notes.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(input_datapath)</p>
<h1>Display the data</h1>
<p>df
```</p>
<p>```markdown</p>

<p><strong>Using OpenAI API Key</strong>To use the OpenAI API, you will need to obtain an API key by signing up for a free account on the OpenAI website and creating a <a href="https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys">new API key</a>. You can then use the API key in your code by setting it as the value of the <code>openai.api_key</code> variable (refer to the code block). You can then use the OpenAI API by making requests to the API's endpoints using the <code>openai</code> library. This will allow you to use the AI-powered text generation capabilities of the OpenAI API in your projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I've made a demo <a href="https://youtu.be/cVBUOQAlrOw">tutorial video</a> that will guide you through this process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively we can use the <code>getpass</code> function to securely input the API key by hiding the user input. ü§´</p>
<p>```python</p>
<h1>Insert our openAI API key</h1>
<h1>https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys</h1>
<p>from getpass import getpass
openai.api_key = getpass()
```</p>
<p><strong>Performing embeddings</strong>The next three lines of code are used to get embeddings and save them for future reuse. The <code>get_embedding</code> function is applied to each row of the <code>df['Notes']</code> column using the <code>apply</code> method. The resulting embeddings are stored in a new column called <code>embedding</code>. Finally, the <code>to_csv</code> function is used to save the dataframe with the new <code>embedding</code> column to a CSV file named "Notes_embedding.csv".</p>
<p>```python</p>
<h1>Choose any embedding models OpenAI provides</h1>
<p>embedding_model = "text-embedding-ada-002"
df['embedding'] = df['Notes'].apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, engine = embedding_model))
df.to_csv('Notes_embedding.csv')
```</p>
<p>Now, let's take a close look at the embeddings - <em><strong>the arrays or vectors formed are numerical representations of the original text data. These vectors are formed by mapping each word or token in the text to a high-dimensional vector in a semantic space, where similar words are located close to each other in this space. Each dimension of the vector corresponds to a specific feature or property of the text.</strong></em></p>

<h3>The code for your semantic search engine web app</h3>
<ol>
<li>Let's head over to our Databutton workspace and generate a state-of-the-art data application named <em>NotebookAI</em>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Below is a screen-grab of the workflow to work with Databutton to create a a new data app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*i9S1sI-SMM0LBUbzG4l5aA.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Now that we've created the <em>NotebookAI</em> app, let's dive into it and explore its features. Although <em>NotebookAI</em> has the potential to be a multipage web application, for our demo purposes, we will focus on the home page and begin building the app from there.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Below is a screen-grab of the workflow to open the Home üè†  page of your generated web app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*0excJjq8Pa1N5Xmw9ybWtQ.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Our initial task is to establish our Python environment (<em>Configuration</em>) because it's necessary to install certain packages that aren't included by default. These additional packages will be essential for the development. The packages necessary to add to the configuration files are : <code>openai</code> , <code>pandas</code> , <code>matplotlib</code> , <code>numpy</code> , <code>plotly</code> , <code>scipy</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> .</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Below is a screen-grab of the workflow to set up the Python dependencies üì¶ </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*Q_unSBicS5h0sf7g24iohQ.png" /></p>
<p>Once our Python environment is set up with the necessary packages installed, we can begin writing our code in the editor. With this setup (<em>side-by-side,</em> consisting of the editor and localhost layout), we can see any changes in real-time as we work over the editor with our codes and view the app development subsequently over the LocalHost. <em>Let's also not forget to toggle on the hot-reloading üî•  button at the top of the editor panel - for instant update of the local host with our codes.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Code Blocks: We will use the following few lines of code, to accomplish a semantic search engine web app in no time. Let's explore the code below in detail.</li>
</ol>
<p>We start by <strong>importing</strong> the necessary modules,</p>
<p><code>python
import numpy as np
import openai
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity, get_embedding</code></p>
<p>From the UI perspective, we use simple Streamlit syntax - where users can create a title for the application and display an emoji and text using the <code>st.title()</code> function. The <code>st.file_uploader()</code> function creates a file uploader widget where users can upload a file. We start with uploading the <code>Embeddings.csv</code> file which we generated via the Notebook step. If a file has been uploaded, the <code>pd.read_csv()</code> function is used to read the contents of the file as a Pandas dataframe, and the <code>data</code> is dumped in the front end as a Streamlit dataframe.</p>
<p>```python
st.title("üìí  Notebook AI ü§ñ ")</p>
<p>file_load = st.file_uploader("Upload Embeddings file")
if file_load:
    data = pd.read_csv(file_load)</p>
<h1>Display the DataFrame</h1>
<pre><code>data
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*JOFQRxftWAHmC7tr0d9TnQ.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above is a screen-grab showing the app in action after few lines of code. The code and local host side-by-side panel help us to inspect both at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further we create, text input widgets for users to add the OpenAI secrets and search queries for our semantic search engine to work.</p>
<p>```bash
user_secret = st.text_input(
        label=":blue[OpenAI API key]",
        placeholder="Paste your openAI API key, sk-",
        type="password",
    )
    if user_secret:
        openai.api_key = user_secret</p>
<pre><code>    # Get the search term from the user through a text input widget
    search_term = st.text_input(
        label=":blue[Search your Query]",
        placeholder="Please, search my notebook with...",
    )

    # Get the search button trigger from the user
    search_button = st.button(label="Run", type="primary")
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<p>One of the most critical aspects of this web app is the usage of <code>search_notebook</code> function implementation. The <code>search_notebook</code> function takes in a dataframe <code>df</code> - which we loaded above, containing notes along with their embeddings, and a <code>search_term</code> as a string. It then retrieves the embedding vector for the <code>search_term</code> using OpenAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" engine, and calculates the cosine similarity between each note's embedding vector and the <code>search_term</code>'s embedding vector. The function returns a new dataframe containing the <code>n</code> most similar notes to the <code>search_term</code>, sorted by similarity in descending order.</p>
<p><code>``python
def search_notebook(df, search_term, n=3, pprint=True):
    """
    Search for the most similar notes in the dataframe</code>df<code>to the</code>search_term`.</p>
<pre><code>Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the notes to be searched through.
    search_term (str): The term to search for.
    n (int, optional): The number of results to return. Defaults to 3.
    pprint (bool, optional): Whether to print the results. Defaults to True.

Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the most similar notes to the `search_term`, sorted by similarity.
"""
# Convert the embeddings in the 'embedding' column from strings to numpy arrays.
df["embedding"] = df["embedding"].apply(eval).apply(np.array)

# Get the embedding for the `search_term` using the "text-embedding-ada-002" engine.
search_embeddings = get_embedding(search_term, engine="text-embedding-ada-002")

# Calculate the cosine similarity between each note's embedding and the `search_term`'s embedding.
df["similarity"] = df["embedding"].apply(
    lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, search_embeddings)
)

# Sort the notes by similarity in descending order and select the top `n` notes.
results = df.sort_values("similarity", ascending=False).head(n)
return results
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below is a screen-grab showing the app in action with text-input widgets. Tip: The ‚Äòpassword' parameter in the API widget helps to hide the API Key, when compared to query text input widget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Image by Author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*VtU-9k2ex0UobMNWbMf4Zw.png" /></p>
<p><code>graphql
        # If the user has entered a search term
        if search_term:
            # And if they have clicked the search button
            if search_button:
                # Run the search function and get the results
                answer = search_notebook(data, search_term, 3, True)
                # Iterate through the results and display the similarity and notes
                for index, row in answer.iterrows():
                    st.write(row["similarity"], row["Notes"])
else:
    st.info("Please Upload the embeddings file.")</code></p>
<p>Clicking, the Run button will execute the <code>search_notebook</code> function as well as any other code present. However, to use the<code>get_embedding</code> function within the <code>search_notebook</code> function, a valid API key needs to be provided. If an invalid API key is provided, an error may occur. To make the app more user-friendly, better error handling can be implemented to handle cases where an invalid API key is provided.</p>
<p>Now, let's test the app and see how it performs!</p>
<p><img alt="Image by author" src="https://miro.medium.com/1*kFjswbPufdiLJnpbtv4d2w.gif" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above the app in action seems to work very well while searching with the user's queries. It throws with the three best similar context, based on the computed similarity index (with the similarity score) - which we previously implemented in the code block.</p>
