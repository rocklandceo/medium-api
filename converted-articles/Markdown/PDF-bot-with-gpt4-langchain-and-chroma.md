The landscape of information consumption and production has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent months, thanks largely to advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of generative AI.

Generative AI has been a game-changer in the digital art scene with [Dall-E2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2), [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/), and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), producing mesmerizing pieces of art that blur the lines between human and machine creativity.

Similarly, LLMs have become a boon for writers and developers, offering them an innovative tool to enhance their creativity, automate tedious tasks, and even debug code.

Today, we are on the brink of another revolutionary application of AI: technology that can interact with and understand your own data (in the form of software documents).

> Imagine the ability to converse with a PDF file. Ask it questions, and receive answers in an instant.

This is not a page from a science fiction novel but a real possibility today, thanks to technologies like GPT-4, Langchain, and Chroma.

Let me give you some context on these technical terms first:

- **[GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) -** the latest iteration of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer, a highly sophisticated large language model (LLM) trained on a vast amount of text data.

- **Langchain** - a framework built around LLMs. It can be used for chatbots, summarization, etc.

- **Chroma** - a high-performance database specifically designed to handle the type of data generated by AI language models.

In this article, I am going to show you how you can set up the AI tool and run it on your local PC as a web application.

### What you can expect

The final web app will let you upload a PDF file and have a conversation in a chatbot interface like this:

### Setup your environment

Before we start with the project setup, download and install the following in your local environment:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - LTS Version: 18.16.0 (includes npm 9.5.1)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- [Git ](https://git-scm.com/downloads)â€” Latest source Release 2.40.1

### Step #1: Clone or download the project

Clone this [GitHub project](https://github.com/chroma-core/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain-chroma) to your local disk.

```bash
gh repo clone chroma-core/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain-chroma
```

### Step #2: Setup the environment

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` , set the OpenAI key to your own secret key, and set the collection name where you'd like to store your embeddings in Chroma.

In a new terminal window, run Chroma in a Docker container.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:0.3.21
```

### Step #3: Set up your documents

Next, you create a folder in your project root called "docs" and place your PDF files there.

Open a terminal and run the command below to begin "ingesting" the content of the PDF file.

```bash
npm run ingest
```

This process involves extracting and contextualizing the data from the PDF file. If this is successful, a success message will be displayed.

### Step #4: Run the app

Finally, run the following command:

```typescript
npm run dev
```

You can begin chatting with your PDF. Awesome!

At present, the latest build does not support multiple PDF files simultaneously, but this feature will likely be added in the future.

### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the idea of chatting with a PDF document using AI may sound far-fetched, but it's a reality today.

This interactive tool not only simplifies the way we access information from PDF documents but also heralds a new era of human-AI interaction.

This is just a simple example of how AI can be used to make PDFs more accessible and interactive. As AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more sophisticated chatbots that can provide even more helpful and informative interactions with PDFs.

Imagine being able to chat with hundreds of PDF files, or having a virtual assistant that can understand and respond to your questions about a complex technical document.
